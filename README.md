# Snow Emergency Data Analysis 

*(1) selecting another research project where Random Forests can be applied, (2) collating all the requisite geospatial data to complete the data, and (3) adapting the Random Forests R code so the model runs on your data.*

## Motivation: what factors affect the likelihood of being tagged (aka ticketed) vs being towed? 

Example set of snow emergencies from snow emergency Westminster, Febriary 2019, from Minneapolis Open Data 

Factors considered so far:

- Ward
- Neighborhood
- Day of snow emergency
- Type of street, local, residential, parkway, collector, highway...
- Driving distance to impound lot
- Driving time to impound lot 

Factors to considered in future version 
- Typical vehicle density in the census block - total vehicles by owner and renter
- Renters vs owners 
- Languages spoken in household (is the city doing enough to communicate with residents who are more fluent in a language other than English?)
